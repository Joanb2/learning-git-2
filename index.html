	<h1>Tool</h1>
	<h2>Vicarious</h2>
	<p>Eye on the TV
		'cause tragedy thrills me
		Whatever flavour
		It happens to be like;
		Killed by the husband
		Drowned by the ocean
		Shot by his own son
		She used the poison in his tea
		And kissed him goodbye
		That's my kind of story
		It's no fun 'til someone dies.</p>
	<p>Don't look at me like
	I am a monster
	Frown out your one face
	But with the other
	Stare like a junkie
	Into the TV
	Stare like a zombie
	While the mother
	Holds her child
	Watches him die
	Hands to the sky crying
	Why, oh why?
	'cause I need to watch things die
	From a distance

	Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies
	You all need it too, don't lie

	Why can't we just admit it?
	Why can't we just admit it?

	We won't give pause until the blood is flowing
	Neither the brave nor bold
	The writers of stories sold
	We won't give pause until the blood is flowing

	I need to watch things die
	From a good safe distance

	Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies
	You all feel the same so
	Why can't we just admit it?

	Blood like rain come down
	Drawn on grave and ground</p>
