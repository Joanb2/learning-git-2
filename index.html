		<h1>Tool</h1>
		<h2>Vicarious</h2>
		<p>Eye on the TV<br>
		'cause tragedy thrills me<br>
		Whatever flavour<br>
		It happens to be like;<br>
		Killed by the husband<br>
		Drowned by the ocean<br>
		Shot by his own son<br>
		She used the poison in his tea<br>
		And kissed him goodbye<br>
		That's my kind of story<br>
		It's no fun 'til someone dies.</p>
		<p>Don't look at me like<br>
		I am a monster<br>
		Frown out your one face<br>
		But with the other<br>
		Stare like a junkie<br>
		Into the TV<br>
		Stare like a zombie<br>
		While the mother<br>
		Holds her child<br>
		Watches him die<br>
		Hands to the sky crying<br>
		Why, oh why?<br>
		'cause I need to watch things die<br>
		From a distance<br><br>

		Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies<br>
		You all need it too, don't lie<br><br>

		Why can't we just admit it?<br>
		Why can't we just admit it?<br>

		We won't give pause until the blood is flowing<br>
		Neither the brave nor bold<br>
		The writers of stories sold<br>
		We won't give pause until the blood is flowing<br><br>

		I need to watch things die<br>
		From a good safe distance<br><br>

		Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies<br>
		You all feel the same so<br>
		Why can't we just admit it?<br><br>

		Blood like rain come down<br>
		Drawn on grave and ground</p>
		<p>Part vampire<br>
		Part warrior<br>
		Carnivore and voyeur<br>
		Stare at the transmittal<br>
		Sing to the death rattle<br><br>

		La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie<br><br>

		Credulous at best, your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of men.<br>
		Pull your head on out your hippy haze and give a listen.<br>
		Shouldn't have to say it all again.<br>
		The universe is hostile. so Impersonal. devour to survive.<br>
		So it is. So it's always been.<br><br>

		We all feed on tragedy<br>
		It's like blood to a vampire<br><br>

		Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies<br>
		Much better you than I.</p>
